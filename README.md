# customscenery-dev

Note: The USSS scenery is already built for FG by our friend M. Danilov (@mimino), but since I aim to include it in the custom scenery directory along with the other Russian airports, I included it along with the rest from the xplane gateway

Polygons I know you're able to obtain, and all the OSM data and shapefiles you'll need can be found at these links:

[Russia](http://download.geofabrik.de/russia.html)
* For our purposes, you'll only need to download files for the Central, Far Eastern, and Siberian federal districts

[South Korea](http://download.geofabrik.de/asia/south-korea.html)

In addition, I used osmosis to crop the section of Turkey for which I'd like to generate osm2city – and I would do it myself, but I don't have fgelev and have never done it before (making me a bit concerned about pushing my laptop too hard resources-wise)
